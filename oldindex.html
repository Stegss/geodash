        <h2>from Geometry Dash by RobTop</h2>

        <h2>The Birth of Stereo Madness</h2>
        <p>Before Geometry Dash became popular, RobTop needed a way to make a good first impression.</p>
        <p>He needed a way to let new players know what they were getting themselves into.</p>
        <p>So he made Stereo Madness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It was the tutorial, but at the same time it wasn't.</p>
        <p>It is a challenge to the new player.</p>
        <p>This lets them know that all future levels would pose as a bigger challenge the farther they get.</p>
        <h3>Stereo Madness shows the player:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How to jump</li>
            <li>How the game feels</li>
            <li>Spikes are bad</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With that very first spike, it sets you off with the main thing you need to know.</p>
        <p>Despite the simplicity of the level, it is iconic in gaming history as the first level you must clear.</p>
