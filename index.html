        <h2><u>ORIGINS OF STEREO MADNESS</u></h2>
        <p>When RobTop was making Geometry Dash, he needed a level that would teach the player</p>
        <p>everything they would need to know without saying a word.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No text.</li>
            <li>No hand holding.</li>
            <li>A short level.</li>
            <li>Teach the player what they need to know.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>So, RobTop designed the level with 3 key principles:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Show the player, don't tell them through text.</li>
            <li>Introduce a new concept or obstacle gradually.</li>
            <li>Make the difficulty curve feel smooth throughout the level.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/8mSq5VwpjYoAAAAM/jungkook-jungkook-gamer.gif">
        <h3>This is why the level introduces these gradually:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Small jumps.</li>
            <li>Consecutive jumps</li>
            <li>Spikes and timed gap jumps</li>
            <li>Longer jumps</li>
            <li>Speed changes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The genius of this level is that each part of it was meant to teach something.</p>
        <p>The beat of the track gets the player on pace with the beat and in the groove.</p>
