        <h2><u>ORIGINS OF STEREO MADNESS</u></h2>
        <p>When RobTop was making Geometry Dash, he needed a level that would teach the player</p>
        <p>everything they would need to know without saying a word.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No text.</li>
            <li>No hand holding.</li>
            <li>A short level.</li>
            <li>Teach the player what they need to know.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>So, RobTop designed the level with 3 key principles:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Show the player, don't tell them through text.</li>
            <li>Introduce a new concept or obstacle gradually.</li>
            <li>Make the difficulty curve feel smooth throughout the level.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/8mSq5VwpjYoAAAAM/jungkook-jungkook-gamer.gif">
        <h3>This is why the level introduces these gradually:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Small jumps.</li>
            <li>Consecutive jumps</li>
            <li>Spikes and timed gap jumps</li>
            <li>Longer jumps</li>
            <li>Speed changes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The genius of this level is that each part of it was meant to teach something.</p>
        <p>The beat of the track gets the player on pace with the beat and in the groove.</p>

        <img src="https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/527255702138751494/53E3C132C0DC30B6C88EC7B275CE64FD5A63FB0B/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false">
        <p>Stereo Madness is a tutorial you don't recognize as a tutorial.</p>
        <p>Theres no text telling you what to do.</p>
        <p>You learn because the level <em>expects</em> you to.</p>
        <p>Everything is intentional. The pacing, spike spacing, platform lengths, and everything else you see.</p>
        <h3>You don't read the instructions, you get a <em>feel</em> for them.</h3>
        <p>As you go on throughout the level, you are better one second than the last.</p>
        <p>By the time you get half way through, you're already way better than you were when you were at the start of the level.</p>

        <h2><u>THE PERFECT MUSIC</u></h2>
        <img src="https://i.namu.wiki/i/3hNZbWotCbxJXSrGqmYBJEukIhG60IqRHiAGdfuoZZibgFbft8zxrMl6Xah-DWaa7QT5J84ku1rgQstkrxYgRg.gif">
        <p>The song itself it also called "Stereo Madness". RobTop made a post on Newgrounds asking for music to use in Geometry Dash.
            An artist called Forever Bound submitted serveral of their songs. Thus, Stereo Madness was chosen to be used in the first level.
        </p>
        <p>But the soundtrack isn't just a banger, it's part of the game's design.
            The tempo and beat trains you to tap with the song's rythm and
            the melody rises during easier sections and deepens during harder sections.   
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Stereo Madness isn't just a song, it isn't just music.
            It is a guide that hides behind the catchy beat.

        <h2><u>THE LEVEL UPDATES</u></h2>
        <p>Over the years, RobTop has kept Stereo Madness relatively the same.
            Though, there have been a few small changes.
        </p>

         <table>
            <tr>
                <th> Version # </th>
                <th> Change </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> 1.6 </td>
                <td> Added 3 Secret Coins</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> 1.9 </td>
                <td> 3rd secrect coin made easier</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> ummm.... </td>
                <td> yeah that is it.</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <h3>Despite Stereo Madness being about 12 years old, it has remained faithful to it's original concepts.</h3>
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/lFqq1S5jr6IAAAAj/geometry-dash-secret-coin.gif">
        <p> Only 3 <strong>optional</strong> secret coins have been added to the level, which allow players to unlock other harder levels if enough are collected.
            These coins were added to all other levels in Geometry Dash as well.</p>
